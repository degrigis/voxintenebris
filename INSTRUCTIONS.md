INDICATIONS TO PLAY THE GAME 
===========================

1- The game is playbale ONLY with the hands, NO controllers! :D 

2- You need a room of at least 4x2 meters ( walk redirection ).

2- First scene is our "Menu", you are supposed to open the door to 
   fall into the nighmare and start to play the game.
   
3- Follow the indication of the spirit to avoid to die. (e.g., "Stay down", "Stay still", ...).

4- You are supposed to walk to reach a series of randomly positioned targets.
   The heatbeat pitch is telling you how far you are from those targets.

5- The increasing breath is telling you how much time do you have left 
   to find those targets.   
   
6- Yelling will light up the room.

7- To break the light just pretend there is a hidden light-bulb on top 
   of the white light we spawn and punch it! 
   
8- Have fun.
