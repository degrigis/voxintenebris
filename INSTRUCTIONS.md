INDICATIONS TO PLAY THE GAME 
===========================

1. The game is playbale ONLY with the hands, NO controllers! :D 

2. You need a room of at least 4x2 meters ( walk redirection ).

3. You need to start in the midlle of one of the two short side of the room and facing the other.

4. First scene is our "Menu", you are supposed to open the door to 
   fall into the nighmare and start to play the game.
   
5. Follow the indication of the spirit to avoid to die. (e.g., "Stay down", "Stay still", ...).

6. You are supposed to walk to reach a series of randomly positioned targets.
   The heatbeat pitch is telling you how far you are from those targets.

7. The increasing breath is telling you how much time do you have left 
   to find those targets.   
   
8. Yelling will light up the room.

9. To break the light just pretend there is a hidden light-bulb on top 
   of the white light we spawn and punch it! 
   
10. Have fun. 


NOTES
=====

1- Unfortunately, we didn't manage to fix an "orientation bug" when dynamically placing the door in the scene, and therefore, we have decided to remove that random event from the final version of the game.
We have tried different rotations and hacks to actually make the door look at the player, but we could't fix that
before the deadline. However, we spawn the door initially before the beginning of the game as a "welcome into the  
nightmare". That's a small bummer, but eventually we believe this feature was not fundamental for the experience.

2- We have decided to render the targets you are supposed to find to make the game a bit easier. 
Our concern was that since we are not there presenting the game, if you don't find them it can be frustrating and can give a bad impression. We want you to reach the end :-)
You can see them by yelling (and therefore lighting up the room) and their position is disclosed by following the sound      of the heartbeat.

3- Overall, we had fun playing with Unity and definitely learning how to code a game using this engine was an interesting and possibly useful experience for the future, thanks for the opportunity!
